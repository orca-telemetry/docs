Orc-a has become Orca Telemetry 🎊.
<!--truncate-->
A few important things have happened recently at Orca HQ.

We have spun out from our parent organisation ([Predixus](https://predixus.com))
into our own entity and have rebranded to **Orca Telemetry**.

Orc-a was an abbreviation for Orchestrated Analytics. The naming was
convenient, and it highlighted the fact that orchestration of 
analyses is a core tenant to the Orca framework \- knowing upfront
when and where analysis should run is _better_ than doing it on the fly.

And as Orca evolved it became clear the streams of data that Orca runs
on is **telemetry**. In addition the 'Orca' brand is fairly saturated, 
and segmenting Orca as an analytics orchestrator that runs on telemetry
data from the name alone was challenging.

Hence **Orca Telemetry** was born. The domain has been acquired and Orca
Telemetry Ltd. is now a legal entity.

I am personally quite excited by this change. Refocusing Orca on the
telemetry brings the product back to its roots, and makes clear the commitment
of Orca in providing a first in class **Telemetry Analytics Engineering**
solution.

Now, let's get to work.
